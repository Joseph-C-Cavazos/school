Cyber

	When the term "cyber" comes to mind, I immediately associate it with "cybersecurity". They are, for the most part, synonymous. However, one thing that I often think about it how often my definition and thoughts on cyber change. Given that about just one year ago, to me, cyber was the same as saying digital, computer, or technology. If it involved a computer of some kind basically, that's what cyber was to me. However, given my advancement over the past year or so, I have grown to associate the term directly with security. There does seem to be a slight difference between cyber and cybersecurity however.
	There are times where I feel that "cyber" is often less formal than "cybersecurity" and the terms are used separately to classify different things. For example, cyber often tends to be associated with the more classic hacker-esque activities and events such as Defcon. When it comes to cybersecurity, I feel as though I am being set up for something coming from a class or academic/industry related. I feel as though startups and hip companies like to use "cyber" as a buzzword whereas the more established and big name brands will use cybersecurity. This is more so my opinion, but don't have much to back it up with.
	Trying to describe the aspects of cyber that appeal to me seems rather difficult in that there has yet to be an aspect that has not appealed to me. Especially since I am naive to the field, I find new avenues quite often and enjoy exploring them. If I were to try and nail it down, I think an overarching theme is that it's just plain fun. Starting with Dr. Maynard's security course where we played with buffer overflows, it was less an assignment and more of a playground. This was what initially exposed me to cyber that only got furthered by the CSA's CTFs, yet another playground that was far too much fun. Everything from groups and events to classes has been fun.
	Whenever I am doing something with cyber, it is always at leisure and very casual as opposed to other topics that I would normally find more frustrating. It's as if I am riding a wave that won't ever hit the beach, just enjoying my time. Additionally, one of the most exciting things is that there's still so much more that I haven't learned about cyber yet that it seems like there will never be an end. The amount that I know about cyber compared to what I know is out there is ridiculous and playing catch up through everything I can is an everyday battle.
	As I mentioned before, it's hard to pin down the aspects I enjoy just because I've enjoyed almost every aspect I've found so far. But I think that's the reason why I see myself working with cyber in the near and far future. I haven't been as hooked on something since I was hooked on programming, and it has only ramped up so far. So in summation, I find cyber fun.
